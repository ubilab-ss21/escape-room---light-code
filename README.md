Light color code challenge
==========================

Goal of this project is to create a working prototype for an escape room challenge,
consisting of several lights and buttons distributed through several rooms.
The objective of the challenge is to find out how to manipulate the color of the different lights and then
make every light shine in  a certain color, which is the code for revealing the next challenge in the escape room
(i.e. open a door or hatch or exposing some information needed for a different challenge).
This color code will have to be obtained from the environment.
